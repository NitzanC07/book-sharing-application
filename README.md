## Vission
Enable every person in the world access to education for free, and encourage actively reading and creativity writing on a regular basis.

## Overview
In the first step I plan to build a web application with focus on two mainly fields. First is to create a sharing books library in that the users are contribute from their own bookshelves. Second is to create platform to encourge people to create their own through games of creative writing, writing alone and together, and give them the first step to write what they want. 

Beside all of this, I make this enterprise as my technical project as a Full Stack web development. I responsible for all the plans of it, and implement it with every technology tools that I learned (and keep learning every time). 

## Technology 
For this project I build both server side and client side, and I use variety of tools:

### Server side (Back end)
* Node.js
* Express.js - As the main framework to build the server.
* MongoDB atlas - To create a database for the users, books and other content of the web application. 
* REST API - To navigate between the routes on the server side.
* I create an Authentication make a personal acount for each user. 

### Client side (Front end)
* React - The main framework to build the user interface, user experiance and the functionality.
* Redux toolkit
* React-router-dom - To navigate between the pages and sections of the web application on the client side.

## Run Locally
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/NitzanC07/book-sharing-application.git
```
2. Go to the project directory.
```bash

```
3. Install dependencies NPM

4. Start run server and client. The server is running on port 5000, and the client running on port 3000.
